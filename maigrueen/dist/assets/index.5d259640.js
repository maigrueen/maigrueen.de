You can find out more about me below. <br> tl;dr: I make my environment a little bit better every day - and I want my colleagues to find it easy to make their own environment a little bit better every day. <br><br> With my educational background - I studied natural sciences in the information society - I have laid a foundation as a communicator between different disciplines from the very beginning. Through my work experience, I was able to develop as an empathetic mediator between different stakeholders. <br> I have already been able to prove my proactive and structured way of working in several projects since 2009. My greatest strength is organisation: Getting a quick grip on what neets to be done, interfacing between different stakeholders to achieve an aligned outcome, and documentating and reporting results: be it within the team, with clients and service providers, or even across disciplines, from creation to controlling. Of course, I am also used to having several projects on the table at the same time. <br> Because I always have holistic improvement in mind, I have had the opportunity to prove myself in organisational development in recent years. At my current employer, I was able to initiate and accompany both recognised quick wins and larger process improvements that accompanied the development as an agile organisation. <br><br> I like to find individual and efficient solutions to achieve goals, tailored to different target groups and strategically chosen objectives. Of course, I also fall back on well-known and proven methods and do not reinvent the wheel every time. I feel particularly comfortable in an agile context. Since sustainability is important to me, I pay particular attention to the communication and involvement of all stakeholders in change management, for individual milestones and features as well as for projects as a whole. </p><h3>Reach out</h3><a href="mailto:astrid@maigrueen.de">write me</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deichmann">find me on LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://github.com/maigrueen">find me on GitHub</a><h3>My core values</h3><p>Autonomy, transparency, learning new stuff - those are my big three. <br> If you don&#39;t mind German check out this link for a fast method to find you core values: <a href="https://einguterplan.de/werte/">Werte-Onlinetest from einguterplan.de</a></p><h3>Tools I love to work with</h3><p> Notion, Atlassian Jira, Atlassian Confluence, Atlassian Service Management, Trello, Microsoft Office Excel </p><h3>Languages</h3><p>German (native), English (B2), Swedish (A1), Spanish (A1)</p><p>Basics in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla, vue.js), proficient in BPMN 2.0</p><h3>Experience</h3>',16),Fe={setup(s){return(l,d)=>(u(),f("div",null,[e("header",null,[Ee,p(L)]),e("main",null,[He,p(Oe)])]))}};k(Fe).mount("#app");
